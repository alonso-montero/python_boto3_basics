# Python Basics

# Intro
In this course we will be learing some basic python concepts.
Why python? In our case it is already installed on our computers and it has simple syntax making it easier to write scripts.

## Syntax 
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code

```python
if 1 < 2:
    print('True')
```

Python has two main ways of commenting:

```python
#single line comments
"""
multi line
comments
"""
```
