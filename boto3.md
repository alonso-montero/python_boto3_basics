# Boto3 Basics

In order to start using boto3 you need to install the sdk

```
pip3 install boto3
```

You also need to configure AWS credentials
This will depend on how you already have them configured.

The easiest way is to create the credentials file ~/.aws/credentials and add your access key and secret access key.
